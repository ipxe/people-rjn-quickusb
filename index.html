<h1>QuickUSB driver for Linux</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Bitwise Systems <a href="http://www.bitwisesys.com/qusb2-p/qusb2.htm">QuickUSB</a> device is a USB 2.0 interface which implements a <b>fast 16-bit parallel port</b> capable of a sustained 12-20 MB/s (chipset-dependent) with handshaking,
  3x general purpose 8-bit I/O ports, I2C, and 2x RS-232 ports.</p>

<p>It is supplied with a binary blob, rather than a proper GPL'd Linux kernel driver, so we wrote one. The driver is hotplug-capable (it won't segfault even if the device is unplugged while in use), and creates standard /dev/ nodes, 
<tt>/dev/qu0g{a-e}</tt> for the general purpose ports, and <tt>/dev/qu0hd</tt> for the high-speed data port (in master mode). The high-speed data port may also be accessed as <tt>/dev/ttyUSB0</tt> (in slave mode).
A small C-program, <tt>setquickusb</tt>, handles the ioctls for the GPIO port-direction masks.</p>

<p>The driver has also been used at XFEL at DESY, and they enhanced it to include a scatter-gather function to aiding the transfer of many MB of data at a time. The driver works under recent 3.x kernels (tested with 3.5 and 3.8); it can also be built under 2.4/2.6.</p>

<p>The VID and PID are 0fbb:0001. Our module identifies as "QuickUSB QUSB2 Module v2.11rc7 (FIFO Handshake)".</p>

<p>Consider also alternatives, such as the <a href="http://lea.hamradio.si/~s57uuu/uuusb/">Uncomplicated Universal Usb board </a></p>


<h2>Bugs</h2>

<p>The QUSB has 2x RS-232 ports, I2C and SPI, but this driver doesn't support them (it would be relatively straightforward to add),</p>

<p>The default power-on direction of the GPIO ports can only be changed by dynamically patching the firmware; this requires the Windows tool.</p>

<p>There is no way to clear the QUSB's internal FIFO to start from a known empty position! Furthermore, the minimum block-size that can be transferred is 64 bytes. This means that there is an uncertainty of 64 bytes in the position within the data-stream.</p>


<h2>Installation</h2>

<ul><li>To install, simply: <tt>make && sudo make install</tt>
